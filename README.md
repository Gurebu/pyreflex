pyreflex
========
This is a pygame-based remake of a popular web game Reflex. The original game can be found at www.missionred.com. The goal of the game is to earn as many points as possible by striking down targets with mouse clicks. White (normal) targets are only affected by left mouse click, while red targets are affected only by right mouse click. Clicking on a target-free area or clicking a target with a wrong button results in a miss, lowering total score by 1500 points. A successful hit results in 1000 points base and up to 500 more depending on how close to the center the hit was.

Every round the number of targets increases by one. If the target disappears, you receive 1 penalty point. No more than 5 penalty points per round are allowed.
